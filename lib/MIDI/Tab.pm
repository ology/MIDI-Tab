=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<MIDI::Tab> allows you to create MIDI files from ASCII tablature.  It
is designed to work alongside C<MIDI::Simple>.

Currently, there are three types of tablature supported: drum, guitar
and piano tab.

Note that bar lines (C<|>) are ignored.  Also the C<control line> may be
specified to alter no-ops for individual notes.

=head1 METHODS

Each of these routines generates a set of MIDI::Simple notes on the object
passed as the first parameter.  The parameters are:

 MIDI:Simple object
 Tab Notes (as ASCII text)
 Noop Arguments (for changing channels etc)

Parameters to the C<from_*_tab()> routines, that are specified after
the tablature string, are passed as C<MIDI::Simple::noop> calls at the
start of the tab rendering.  For example, the length of each unit
of time can be specified by passing a C<MIDI::Simple> duration value
(e.g. 'sn').

Additionally, a C<control line> for individual note modification may
be included in the tab, at the same vertical position as the note it
modifies.  This line must be named B<CTL>.  At this point it is only
used to specify triplet timing.

=head2 from_guitar_tab()

  from_guitar_tab($object, $tab_text, @noops)

Notes are specified by an ASCII guitar where each horizontal line
represents a guitar string (as if the guitar were laid face-up in
front of you).

Time runs from left to right.  You can 'tune' the guitar by specifying
different root notes for the strings.  These should be specified as a
C<MIDI::Simple> alphanumeric absolute note value (e.g. 'A2').  The
numbers of the tablature represent the fret at which the note is
played.

=head2 from_drum_tab()

  from_drum_tab($object, $tab_text, @noops)

Each horizontal line represents a different drum part and time runs
from left to right.  Minus or plus characters represent rest intervals.
As many or as few drums as required can be specified, each drum having
a two or three letter code, such as C<BD> for the General MIDI "Bass
Drum 1" or C<SD> for the "Acoustic Snare."  These are all listed in
C<%MIDI::Tab::drum_notes>, which can be viewed or altered by your code.

The numbers on the tablature represent the volume of the drum hit,
from 1 to 9, where 9 is the loudest.
